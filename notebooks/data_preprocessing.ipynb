By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!",
         "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "

         "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects.

Please suggest wat we should do",

Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause.

This is great news that cardiac problems are ruled out by the tests every time in the emergency Room. This means that we have to find a local cause in the abdomen itself. I would suggest the following:Get Ct scan and MRCP for the hepato-biliary- pancreatic system. Also go for upper GI Endoscopy to rule out Gastric ulcer. Cancer. Colonoscopy for the possible problem of the colon in this area. If required a diagnostic Laparoscopy may help to see or rule out the intestinal adhesion due to bands or kinking or so and can be tackled at the same time.

I sometimes wake up with chest pains too. i have a strong history of heart disease. grandfather died at 26 from a heat attack and mother had one at 45, also grandmother on the other side had a heart attack. Could you please explain what is happening? Thanks",
         "HelloThanks for posting at Chat Doctor. You have not provided your age on the details. I would have been able to help u better had you mentioned your age. You have complaints of chest pain radiating to back with strong family history. So in your case it is better that we evaluate you for presence of heart disease. I recommend an ECG and 2d echo initially. If both these tests are normal you can proceed for a treadmill test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously monitored. This will show if the heart blood supply suffers while you are exercising which indirectly predicts whether you have blockages in your heart. Please do the above tests and revert. Wishing you good healthRegards."

         "Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get with Chat Doctor.  However, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. I hope this clarifies the issue. "

         "Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!"

The doctor drilled out the pulp (noting that it was mostly dead) and put on a temporary filling until the root canal specialist could see me.  Now, about 36 hours later, Im in quite a bit of pain again, both on the tooth that was operated on and in a molar on the top of my jaw and in the back jaw muscle.  My neck is rather swollen too and is tender to the touch.  I have plans to travel tomorrow by plane to see some family and go diving.  Is my condition something that requires immediate attention?

Now, while removing those dead pulp/ remaining tissue or washing the root canal, there is every possibility that some part of that infected material pushed through the root apex foramen(hole) to the surrounding area. Naturally that area become infected and in many instances the infection expressed as an acute infection of root apex area with pain and may be with swelling. It is called ENDODONTIC FLARE UP. It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal. The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmenting or same type (Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125 mg) 8 hourly for 5 days. Along with that you have to take Diclofenac 100 mg + Paracetamol 500 mg, 3 times a day in full stomach. If you have a history of excessive acidity, you have to take 10 ml of any liquid antacid before taking Diclofenac.  Your pain will subside with in 2 to 3 days. But continue Antibiotic for 5 days.

The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication. The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects.

Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition.

Now, about 36 hours later, Im in quite a bit of pain again, both on the tooth that was operated on and in a molar on the top of my jaw and in the back jaw muscle.

Now, while removing those dead pulp/ remaining tissue or washing the root canal, there is every possibility that some part of that infected material pushed through the root apex foramen(hole) to the surrounding area. Naturally that area become infected and in many instances the infection expressed as an acute infection of root apex area with pain and may be with swelling. It is called ENDODONTIC FLARE UP. It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal. The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmenting or same type (Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125 mg) 8 hourly for 5 days. Along with that you have to take Diclofenac 100 mg + Paracetamol 500 mg, 3 times a day in full stomach. If you have a history of excessive acidity, you have to take 10 ml of any liquid antacid before taking Diclofenac. Your pain will subside with in 2 to 3 days. But continue Antibiotic for 5 days.

As right side of jaw is causing you pain, let us focus on that only. Due to absence of physical space to come out in mouth or due to its improper position, it might be possible that the wisdom tooth of that side was locked in the jaw all this time and now might be impinging on the muscle of the mastication or nerve that supplies tongue causing you the pain and discomfort you are experiencing.

You should do at least ultrasound or CT scan to evaluate it more accurately. This is caused by stone in bile duct and is very common condition. Surgery is recommended in this case and if you don't want it now then you need to change your dietary habits first. You need to avoid fried food, carbonated . You should eat more milk products, vegetables and boiled food. If there is no improvement on lifestyle or dietary changes, then surgery is recommended. Other causes include pancreatitis or pleuordinia and should be considered if gallbladder stones are ruled out. I hope I have answered you query.

Sebum lubricates the hair. It is common in this area.it is treated by excision surgically. Other possibilities areMycetoma which is fungal infection caused by actinomyces.it is treated by antifungals such as ketoconazole or fluconazole.

She is a smoker who recently had her thyroid out ( small amount of cancer at the centre) and last night at a work function someone mentioned to her that he cough sounded like lung spurs caused by peumonia. Apparently this person had suffered something similar with this diagnosis. My mum insists she is starting to feel better but I am concerned that she needs to visit a Dr which she keeps avoiding. What are lung spurs and could these synptoms indicate she has something more than a cold/flu? She is 62 years old, a little overweight but not majorly and she has a golf ball sized growth on the rhs of her neck. Apparently it is benign, but it was tested a long time ago and appears to me to keep growing. she was meant to have it removed through surgery at the start of the year but has avoided that too. Thanks.",
         "Spurs, by medical definition is a short pointed growth or process on a part of the body. With your moms case, it could be calcium deposits, accumulating causing this process. Calcium deposits are small accumulations of calcium, which can accumulate anywhere in your body. These create bone spurs, kidney and gall stones, and, in the shoulder, tendonitis. Many calcium deposits don't require medical treatment (they can even be reabsorbed right back into your body). In the lungs, however, they can be a sign that you have a serious underlying condition that is causing them to form. While calcium deposits in the lung are usually benign (non-cancerous), they can become malignant. Calcium deposits should be monitored both to prevent cancer, and because many of the conditions that cause calcification are also serious."

         "Infected broken tooth can lead to pain and soreness of cheeks and jaws. Constant cheek irritation by broken tooth can also cause pain and tenderness. If tooth is broken, then you need treatment for your broken tooth. If nerve of the tooth is not exposed, then tooth can be restored with dental filling or crown but if nerve of the tooth is exposed or necroses, then root canal treatment followed by dental crown is required for the tooth. If tooth is badly mutilated, then post and core procedure is required after root canal therapy. If broken tooth is unrestorable, then tooth extraction followed by replacement of missing tooth with dental implants or dental bridge is required. Only pain meds will be of little help. Hot compresses are not indicated as they will aggravate the swelling. You can do warm saline rinses to reduce the swelling. You need to get treatment done for infected tooth. If you have cost constrains, then you can visit a dental school where treatment is done by dental students under supervision of experienced dentists. You can also look for free dental clinics near you or can talk to your local dentist if you can pay in installments for treatment. By the time you visit your dentist, you can avoid eating from side of broken tooth. You can also apply travel for some relief. Maintain good oral hygiene to avoid any secondary infections"

You need not start it again to satisfy uncontrollable urge to do so. Trey self-control/ counseling/ chewing clove/ beetle nut as an alternative.

         "I hope you are under required treatment for follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma prognosis varies with the risk factors. The high risk factors are age above 60 years, stage III or IV disease, more than 4 groups of lymph nodes involved, blood hemoglobin less than 12 gram/ DL and raised serum LDH level. As you have at least 2 of the above therefore you are under intermediate risk. At intermediate risk, patients with follicular lymphoma under treatment might have 78 percent survival at 5 years and 51 percent survival at 10 years. Follicular lymphoma is a slow growing type of lymphoma which responds very well to treatment, but can rarely be cured. Despite the fact that it cannot be cured, the prognosis is generally very good, and the median survival is about 8-15 years in many people who have it."

         "ALLERGY - Respiratory . Hello, my uncle (65 yrs) has been having sinusitis for the past 30 years. About 6 months ago, he had a new consisting with a bit of cough + phlegm building on his throat . So far, the meds that my uncle was prescribed until now wereAerius / Telfast / Clarinese / Xyzal. Recently, he was given ampules for own injections (daily) just in case his allergy got worse. The doctor that prescribed didn t want to let us know the meds ingredients. So far, after getting the injections, my uncle s allergy was getting better. But we re curious WHY the doctor didn t want tell us about the meds. Our question, is there such thing as INJECTION medicine intended for allergy purpose? Also.. recently, my uncle was prescribed with another meds -- Singulair, on top of those meds above + the injection meds. Please advise.",
         "Yes there is an emergency injection that can be taken subcutaneously in an emergency and is sometimes handed over to patients for use in an emergency. Rest of your medications are for asthma and allergy. His doctor has probably not told him details of the injection because it may unnecessarily create anxiety if he reads about it. I am sure his doctor would have told him how to use the injection and what to expect. If he is a specialist, I am sure he knows what he is doing, and you must trust him. Regards"

I have been taking methotrexate still for RA.",
         "From your given history your swelling could be due to an old trauma, cardiac or renal problems. If your edema is bilateral this is a sign of underlying systemic disease if cardiac output exceeds its output (heart failure) or your kidneys cannot wash or flush your venous system .in rare cases your medication may cause such symptoms if used for long periods. You have to maintain leg elevation, avoid standing or bending your knees for a long time and use hot foments with topical gels of anti-inflammatory.wearing compression stockings will be helpful to push up blood towards the heart and increase your venous return. If you have not examined your arterial system by Doppler U/S you may need to check them up in very rare cases arterial system clots or atherosclerosis may occur and cause such edema. I recommend full lab investigations and follow them up with your physician for proper evaluation and management of the exact underlying cause.

In my clinical practice most pains are just muscular and can be helped with therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy.

I know I ve had swelling and pain in my lower back and have been taking Ibuprofen and Neproxan to help that (no.. I didn t go the the ER or see a doctor but lower back pain is common with this type of injury and a few months earlier I hurt my lower back where the Dr said that there was swelling in that area). That has helped me to move around and function. My question is, would the pain cause phantom pain on my left side around my hip (not hip.. a little higher) area? You know where you put your hands on your hips but your hands are above the hip.. right there is so uncomfortable that it hurts to roll over or turn. What do you think (besides going to see a Doctor). :)",
         "As you mentioned you faced an accident and after which you are having a pain in the hip. As reading your history, I can understand that you were hit from behind, and then you had a fall. Now to understand this mechanism, you need to understand some physics here. As when you are hit from behind, your body is not prepared to take the force applied on it. Also, due to the hit from the back, the body has gone into extension in the spine level and later on fallen down. So there might be chances of soft tissue injury which needs an assessment. Also, an MRI of the lumbar spine is advised. I agree to you, that most RTA will have back pain, and all are not serious, but without examining deciding on a general term is a baseless understanding. Taking self-medication is also not advised, as if the injury is big you may be trying to reduce the pain, but the other factors of the soft tissue injury will be present and may get worsen as well. I will advise to get your spine assessed, as spine is an important segment in the human body and needs a real attention. Also to understand that, due to any injury now, the later disadvantages are present. After all it's totally your call and you can decide better. RegardsJay In ."

         "Hi. I am female of 25 years old. I have been married past 1 and half years. We were in planning stage. But since from two months we are trying for a baby. Last month we tried intercourse regularly that is i between 10 th day to 20th day. As We were knowing that ovulation occurs in between 12 to 16th day. During intercourse all the semen completely ejected into vagina. After sometime means after a hour it starts spilling out. We were in a hope that this month we can get a positive results but it was in a vain. And also the peneteration was medium. Let me know what is the reason of not getting conceive?",
         "In normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). It is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctor's office. The best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. Premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. There are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. Many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. So in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. I encourage you and your husband to have patience. In the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,"

         "If the sonogram performed was through the trans-vaginal route and if your sonographer is an experienced person, it is likely that you may have miscarried, provided you have regular cycles and did not miscalculate. When this is not so, it is better to wait and see. In such a scenario, serial titles of serum beta- are often done. Good progress of pregnancy is indicated by doubling of titles every 2-3 days. This should be coupled with follow-up sonograms. Wish you good health."

Tamsulosin) and pain relieving medications. If the pain does not subside or kidney function deteriorates or infection sets in, then it needs to be removed immediately. Otherwise, the stone can be monitored and if it does not pass in 4 weeks then it can be removed using endoscopy (URS, ureterorenoscopy).

Usually the urine pregnancy test gives accurate results if done a week after missed period. So you can consider doing a urine pregnancy test. The other symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts start 2 weeks after missed period in case of pregnancy. So the delayed period, tiredness might give a suspicion of pregnancy but needs to be confirmed. Kindly consider doing a urine pregnancy test. Other tests to diagnose pregnancy are blood test and ultrasound. Blood test gives results well before the expected periods time i.e.., around 10 days after ovulation. Ultrasound helps in diagnosis of pregnancy around 5-6 weeks of pregnancy. Hope this helps. Best regards...."
